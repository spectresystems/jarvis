# Privacy Policy

Jarvis respects user's privacy and it does not collect any 
personal information from user without explicitly asking for user's consent.

Jarvis will only index data available in the current user's scope.  
Indexed data is never transmitted over the internet.

### Search engines

When using a search engine from Jarvis such as Wikipedia or Google, 
an external call is made to that search engine with the query that 
the user specifies. Again, no personal data is transmitted in this call.
